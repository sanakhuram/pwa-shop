Welcome to **PWA Shop**! 🎉 This is a **Progressive Web Application (PWA)** that lets you browse products, add them to your cart 🛍️, and even install the app on your device 📱 for offline shopping! With service worker magic ✨, it provides fast loading and offline access.

## Features

- **📴 Offline support**: Browse the app even when you're offline thanks to cached resources!
- **📲 Installable PWA**: Add the app to your home screen and use it like a native app.
- **🛍️ Dynamic product list**: Check out products and add them to your cart.
- **🔄 Service worker**: Smart caching for faster load times and offline mode.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository 🖥️

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/pwa-shop.git
cd pwa-shop
```

### 2. Run a local server 🏃‍♂️

To test the PWA features, you need to run the app over HTTP. Here’s how to do it using `http-server`:

```bash
# Install http-server if you don't have it
npm install -g http-server

# Start the server
http-server -c-1
```

### 3. Access the app 🌐

Go to `http://localhost:8080` to see the app in action in your browser! 🎉

### 4. Test the PWA ⚡️

- Check out the shop page (`/shop.html`) and browse the products.
- Install the PWA by clicking the "Install App" button or by using the browser’s install feature.
- Turn off your internet 🌐 and reload the page to see it work offline! 🙌

## 📁 Key Files

### 1. **index.html** & **shop.html**

These are the main pages of the app. The shop page displays the products and contains the cart 🛒.

### 2. **styles.css**

Contains the styling 🎨 for the app, including layout, responsiveness, and design for the product list and cart.

### 3. **app.js**

The main JavaScript file 📜 that manages app logic like displaying products and setting up the cart.

### 4. **productService.js**

Handles loading products dynamically and rendering them on the page 💻.

### 5. **cartService.js**

Manages the cart functionality, including adding items to the cart and showing the cart contents 🛍️.

### 6. **installService.js**

Handles the PWA installation prompt and helps users install the app 📲.

### 7. **service-worker.js**

The Service Worker 🛠️ responsible for caching key resources and making the app available offline. Key lifecycle events include:
- **Install**: Caches the main resources.
- **Fetch**: Serves assets from the cache if available, or fetches from the network.
- **Activate**: Cleans up old caches.

### 8. **manifest.json**

The manifest file 📜 provides metadata about the PWA, including name, icons, and theme color.

## 🧙‍♂️ How It Works

1. **Service Worker**: The service worker caches the app’s assets, enabling offline functionality. It intercepts network requests and either serves resources from the cache or fetches them from the network. 📦
   
2. **Cache Versioning**: The cache is versioned using `CACHE_NAME`. Each time assets change, the version number should be updated (e.g., from `v1` to `v2`). This ensures that the old cache is replaced with the new one. 🔄

3. **PWA Installation**: Users can install the app 📲, and it can work like a native mobile or desktop application.

4. **Offline Support**: Once cached, the app will work offline, serving cached content when there’s no network. 🌐❌

## 🛠️ How to Update the Cache

1. Update the cache name in the `service-worker.js` file (e.g., from `v1` to `v2`).
2. Update the `urlsToCache` array, if necessary.
3. Deploy the new version! The service worker will automatically clean up old caches and replace them with the new one. 🔄
